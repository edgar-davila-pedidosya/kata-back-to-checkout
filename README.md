# kata-back-to-checkout
This is the base project/settings for the kata inspired in 'back to checkout' by Dave Thomas (@PragDave)(http://codekata.com/kata/kata09-back-to-the-checkout/)

## How to kata?
- First of all: Split all participants in pairs (more people is allowed in a group so nobody is left alone), any pair/group should be formed by people who do not usually code together.
- The exercise is splitted in iterations which resemble real-life sprints or periods of time, every iteration adds up requirements to the base exercise.
- Every iteration is composed by 5-minute periods where only one developer is allowed to code (ideally each group will work on one computer).
- It is advised to not read the following iterations as you may ruin the element of surprise (in real-life scenarios we never know when or how requirements change)

## What do you need?
- IntelliJ IDEA
- Scala Plugin for IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/discover-intellij-idea-for-scala.html)

For online katas, you might consider adding:
- Teamhub Plugin for IntelliJ (https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11955-teamhub)
